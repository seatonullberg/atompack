## Installation

### Download from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/atompack/)

This is the best method for end users.

```bash
$ pip install atompack

### Build from source

This is the best method for contributors or anyone who is interested in modifying the code.

```

#### 2. Download the dependencies and install as editable:

This step can be done with either `pipenv` or `pip`. I recommend using `pipenv`. If you're not familiar with the benefits of using `pipenv`, find out more about it here: https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

For `pipenv` users:

For `pip` users:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -e . [dev]
```
