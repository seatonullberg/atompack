    Notes:
        Any `kwargs` passed to `__init__()` are dynamically set as instance variables.
        This enables arbitrary atomic data to be associated with each instance in an elegant and pythonic way.

    Args:
        position: Location vector in 3D cartesian space.
            Mutating `position` is a logical error if the change results in atoms overlapping or a translation out of bounds.
